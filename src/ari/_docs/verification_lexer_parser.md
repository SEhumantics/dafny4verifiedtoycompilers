# Verification of the Lexer and Parser

----

## Contents

The lexer and parser are generated using ANTLR 4. The generated Python code is originally in the `antlr\.antlr` directory (which was automatically generated by the VSCode extension for ANTLR 4). The lexer and parser are in the `AriLexer.py` and `AriParser.py` files, respectively.

For easier navigation, the generated files are moved to the `antlr` folder. Remember to move the generated files after generating them (also, delete the lines which have the form `# Generated from <some path>` in the lexer and parser files if needed, since they reveal the directory on your machine).

This part of the compiler is not formally verified. It is generated code that is assumed to be correct. But we have our reasons to believe that it is correct, since ANTLR 4 is a well-tested tool that is widely used in the industry.

For now, using ANTLR 4 is a reasonable and pragmatic choice.
